Modulo Math stuff for Programming bitcoin book
When the number is positive and less than the mod number, return the number so 15 % 19 = 15
When the number is positive and greater than the mod number, return the remainder when divided by the mod so 20 % 19 = 1
When the number is equal to the mod return 0 so 19 % 19 = 0

Addition and Subtraction
(7,13) + (12,13) = (19,13) then you do 19 % 13 which equals 6 so you end up with (6,13) 
(7,13) - (12,13) = (-5,13) then you do -5 % 13 which equals 8 so you end up with (8,13)
