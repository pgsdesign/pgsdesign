What's up with encoding and the common bitcoin ones

What is an encoding?
taking some normal information - ie want to tell someone the number 5, tell them out loud, but since computers it has to be written down, send character 5, takes up 1 space, take info like 5 or 10 and how we write that down and express it. 
the other person we want to send it to needs to decode the info so we need a shared understanding of the encoding being used
what character set is it?
weird language - Y means 5 as we are used to it.
If I didn't tell you I was using weird language you would not understand how to interpret the info
cool thing about encodings - translate between one encoding to the next so it could be "5" or "the number five"
