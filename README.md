- 👋 Hi, I’m @pgsdesign
- 👀 I’m interested in bitcoin and the lightning network
- 🌱 I’m still processing the bitcoin transaction class with @niftynei of @base58btc - It's going to take a while, but I'm working through Mastering Bitcoin again and seeing it with fresh eyes...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner stuff in this space as I get my shit together.
